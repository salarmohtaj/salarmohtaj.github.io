excerpt: 'Social networks can play a crucial role in a range of diffusion of information and knowledge, from the adoption of political opinions and technologies, to educational and learning usages. Thus knowledge sharing is one of the main purposes of people for using these networks. The main problem regarding to using social networks as a knowledge source is lacking of a criterion for determine validity of the diffused knowledge in these networks. Finding experts in social networks and knowing the level of users' knowledge can help to solve this problem by ranking users and validating their posts. In this paper we proposed a model for finding experts in social networks. This model is based on the structure of corresponding network and implicit flow of information in network and proposed according to SNPageRank algorithm.'
